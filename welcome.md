Welcome to SPCE5025 - Fundamentals of Astronautics. 
 
Live, on-line classes begin on Tuesday, 20 January 2026 at 7:00 pm Mountain Time, and will occur every Tuesday at 7:00 pm Mountain Time.   If you cannot attend in person, all on-line sessions are recorded and made available for later reference.
 
Note: Some lectures may be rescheduled due to instructor conflicts.  Class 2 will be on MONDAY, 26 January  at 7:00 pm Mountain Time.

On-line "Office Hours" sessions are on Thursdays at 7:00 pm Mountain Time.
 
Course Aims – The emphasis of this course is on giving you some familiarity with topics that are common and widespread within the Space Operations discipline, including orbital mechanics, coordinate transformations and pointing, satellite observations, and a variety of supporting computations. 
 
Purely optional: So that I can better present the subject matter, I find it helpful to get an idea of your technical and work background.  If you wish to provide brief background description of (a few sentences at most), please feel free to do so.

The course syllabus and class presentations are available on Canvas, in the Modules area. Materials for a given week will always be available well before the scheduled session, as will the homework solutions.
  
Microsoft Teams – All on-line sessions will use Microsoft Teams.  I have included each of you on the Teams invitation for both lectures and office hours (two separate invites); please let me know if you have not received a notification, and I will ensure that you're on the invitation list. 
 
I will open the meeting prior to each class session, and you will automatically be provided an e-mail link to the conference.
 
Fair warning: This is a computation-intensive course, and you will be writing programs.  You will want access to a programming language, or a computational environment such as MATLAB.  You may program in any language you wish.
 
UCCS offers free student access to MATLAB.  For details, go to  
 https://kb.uccs.edu/display/KB/MATLAB+Installation+Guide
 
Many languages and development environments may be downloaded for free from the internet, including Python, Java, Visual Studio (including C, C++, C#), Java, and others.
 
I look forward to working with you during this semester!
